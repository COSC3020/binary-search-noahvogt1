I used chatGPT to help find the case to return -1 because i couldnt figure out the condition or where to put it in the code. Which in hindesight makes total sense and I understand it better now.

Implement a binary search function that, given a sorted list and an element to
look for, returns the index of the element in the list or -1 if the element is
not there.

Use the template in `code.js`. The tests in `code.test.js` will be run
automatically every time you push to Github; if they pass you are done.
